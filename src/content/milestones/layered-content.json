    "tldr": "First mathematical model showing how brain cells could compute.",
    "simpleExplanation": "In 1943, two scientists asked: could we describe how brain cells work using math? They created a simple model where artificial 'neurons' receive signals, add them up, and fire if the total is high enough. Think of it like a voting system—if enough inputs say 'yes,' the neuron activates.\n\nThis wasn't meant to build computers that think. It was meant to understand biology. But it planted a seed: if brains compute, maybe we could build machines that compute the same way.",
    "businessImpact": "- Established the theoretical foundation for all neural network technology used today\n- Created the conceptual bridge between biology and computing\n- Influenced decades of AI research direction\n- Every modern AI system—from ChatGPT to image recognition—traces back to this foundational idea",
    "technicalDepth": "McCulloch and Pitts proposed that neurons could be modeled as binary threshold units. Each artificial neuron receives weighted inputs, sums them, and outputs 1 if the sum exceeds a threshold, 0 otherwise. This is essentially a linear classifier.\n\nThey proved these networks could compute any logical function (AND, OR, NOT), making them theoretically equivalent to Turing machines. However, they didn't propose a learning algorithm—weights were set by hand.\n\nThe model abstracted away biological complexity (timing, chemistry, continuous signals) to focus on logical computation, which made it tractable for analysis but limited its biological accuracy.",
    "historicalContext": "This work emerged during WWII when scientists were thinking deeply about computation and control systems. Norbert Wiener's cybernetics movement was exploring feedback loops in machines and organisms. McCulloch was a neurophysiologist; Pitts was a self-taught logician.\n\nTheir collaboration represented an early interdisciplinary approach that would characterize AI research for decades.",
    "whyItMattersToday": "Every neural network powering today's AI—from ChatGPT to Tesla's autopilot—descends conceptually from this 1943 paper's idea that computation can emerge from simple connected units.",
    "commonMisconceptions": "- ❌ \"This was the first AI\" → ✅ It was a theoretical model of biological neurons, not an AI system\n- ❌ \"These networks could learn\" → ✅ The original model had no learning mechanism; weights were fixed\n- ❌ \"It accurately models real brains\" → ✅ It's a vast simplification—real neurons are far more complex"

    "tldr": "Defined how to measure and transmit information mathematically.",
    "simpleExplanation": "Claude Shannon asked a simple question: how do you measure information? His answer: information is about reducing uncertainty. If I tell you something you already knew, that's zero information. If I tell you something surprising, that's lots of information.\n\nHe created formulas to measure this precisely, using 'bits' as the unit. This let engineers calculate exactly how much data could flow through phone lines, radio waves, or any channel—and how to compress messages without losing meaning.",
    "businessImpact": "- Enabled all digital communication: internet, cell phones, WiFi, Bluetooth\n- Created the theoretical basis for data compression (ZIP files, MP3s, streaming video)\n- Made error-correcting codes possible (CDs, QR codes, satellite communication)\n- Influenced machine learning's use of entropy and cross-entropy loss functions",
    "technicalDepth": "Shannon formalized information as the reduction of uncertainty, measured in bits. His entropy formula H = -Σ p(x) log p(x) quantifies the average information content of a message source.\n\nHe proved the channel capacity theorem: every communication channel has a maximum rate at which information can be transmitted reliably, and this limit can be approached using appropriate coding schemes.\n\nShannon also introduced the concept of mutual information, which measures how much knowing one variable tells you about another—a concept central to modern machine learning objectives.",
    "historicalContext": "Shannon developed this theory while working at Bell Labs on improving telephone communication. The paper drew on earlier work by Nyquist and Hartley on telegraph transmission rates.\n\nThe timing was significant: digital computers were just emerging, and Shannon's theory provided the mathematical framework for the coming digital revolution.",
    "whyItMattersToday": "Every time you stream Netflix, send a text, or use WiFi, you're benefiting from Shannon's theory. Modern AI training also uses information-theoretic concepts like cross-entropy loss.",
    "commonMisconceptions": "- ❌ \"Information theory is about meaning\" → ✅ Shannon explicitly excluded semantics; it's about statistical patterns\n- ❌ \"Bits only matter for computers\" → ✅ The theory applies to any communication, including biological systems\n- ❌ \"This directly created AI\" → ✅ It's foundational infrastructure, not AI itself"

    "tldr": "Proposed testing machine intelligence through conversation.",
    "simpleExplanation": "Alan Turing asked: how would we know if a machine can think? His answer: have a human chat with both a machine and another human (without seeing either). If the human can't tell which is which, the machine passes the test.\n\nThis clever approach sidesteps philosophical debates about 'real' thinking. Instead of defining intelligence, Turing defined a practical test for it. It's like saying: if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, we might as well call it a duck.",
    "businessImpact": "- Provided the first practical framework for evaluating AI capabilities\n- Inspired decades of chatbot and conversational AI development\n- Shaped public expectations of what 'intelligent' AI should look like\n- Still referenced in marketing and media coverage of AI advances like ChatGPT",
    "technicalDepth": "The test, originally called the 'Imitation Game,' involves three participants: a human interrogator, a human respondent, and a machine. All communication is text-based to remove physical cues.\n\nTuring predicted that by 2000, machines would fool 30% of interrogators in 5-minute conversations. He also addressed objections: theological ('machines can't have souls'), mathematical (Gödel's incompleteness), and the 'Lady Lovelace objection' (machines can only do what they're programmed to do).\n\nModern critiques note the test measures deception ability rather than intelligence, and that passing it doesn't require understanding.",
    "historicalContext": "Turing wrote this just five years after his wartime work breaking the Enigma code, which involved both mathematical brilliance and early computing machinery. The paper appeared in a philosophy journal, reflecting how AI questions spanned disciplines.\n\nThe 1950s saw growing optimism about machine capabilities, and Turing's paper helped frame the research agenda.",
    "whyItMattersToday": "ChatGPT and similar systems have essentially passed informal Turing tests, reigniting debates about what the test actually measures and whether conversational ability equals intelligence.",
    "commonMisconceptions": "- ❌ \"Passing the test means the machine is conscious\" → ✅ The test only measures behavioral indistinguishability\n- ❌ \"No machine has passed the Turing Test\" → ✅ Modern chatbots regularly fool people in casual conversation\n- ❌ \"Turing thought this test was definitive\" → ✅ He proposed it as one approach, acknowledging limitations"

    "tldr": "The proposal that gave AI its name and launched the field.",
    "simpleExplanation": "In 1955, four scientists wrote a funding proposal for a summer workshop at Dartmouth College. They wanted to explore whether machines could be made to simulate intelligence. They coined the term 'artificial intelligence' and boldly claimed that significant progress could be made in one summer with ten researchers.\n\nThe workshop itself (held in 1956) didn't achieve its ambitious goals, but it brought together the founding figures of AI and established it as a distinct research field with its own identity and agenda.",
    "businessImpact": "- Created AI as a recognized field of study and research funding category\n- Established the optimistic, ambitious culture that still characterizes AI\n- United researchers who would lead AI for the next 50 years\n- The name 'artificial intelligence' shaped public perception and expectations",
    "technicalDepth": "The proposal outlined several research directions: automatic computers, programming languages, neuron nets, theory of computation size, self-improvement, abstractions, and randomness and creativity.\n\nNotably, the organizers believed 'a significant advance can be made' if a group of scientists worked on it for a summer. This optimism about timelines became a recurring pattern in AI history.\n\nThe workshop participants included McCarthy, Minsky, Shannon, and Newell—names that would dominate AI for decades.",
    "historicalContext": "The mid-1950s saw computers transitioning from military/scientific tools to broader applications. The success of early programs like the Logic Theorist (which proved mathematical theorems) created genuine excitement.\n\nThe Dartmouth proposal reflected post-war American optimism about technology solving fundamental problems.",
    "whyItMattersToday": "The field they named now powers products used by billions. The original optimism about quick progress has parallels in today's AGI predictions—some see this as vision, others as recurring overconfidence.",
    "commonMisconceptions": "- ❌ \"AI was invented at Dartmouth\" → ✅ The workshop named and organized existing research threads\n- ❌ \"They achieved their summer goals\" → ✅ The workshop produced discussions, not breakthroughs\n- ❌ \"The founders agreed on approaches\" → ✅ Deep divisions (symbolic vs. neural) emerged immediately"

    "tldr": "First machine that could learn from examples.",
    "simpleExplanation": "Frank Rosenblatt built a machine that could learn to recognize patterns—not by being programmed with rules, but by being shown examples. Show it pictures of triangles labeled 'triangle' and squares labeled 'square,' and it would gradually learn to tell them apart.\n\nThis was revolutionary: instead of humans writing rules, the machine discovered its own rules from data. It's like teaching a child by showing examples rather than explaining grammar rules.",
    "businessImpact": "- Demonstrated that machines could learn from data, not just follow rules\n- Inspired the first wave of neural network research and funding\n- Created the template for supervised learning still used today\n- The basic idea (adjust weights based on errors) underlies all modern deep learning",
    "technicalDepth": "The perceptron is a single-layer neural network that computes a weighted sum of inputs and applies a threshold function. Learning uses the perceptron convergence algorithm: if the output is wrong, adjust weights toward the correct answer.\n\nRosenblatt proved that if a linear separation exists between classes, the algorithm will find it in finite steps. This was exciting but also limiting—many problems aren't linearly separable.\n\nThe Mark I Perceptron hardware used 400 photocells connected to neurons with adjustable potentiometers as weights.",
    "historicalContext": "The perceptron emerged during the Cold War, with military funding seeking pattern recognition for tasks like identifying tanks in aerial photos. Early demonstrations generated enormous media hype.\n\nRosenblatt's work built on McCulloch-Pitts neurons but added the crucial element of learning.",
    "whyItMattersToday": "Modern neural networks are essentially many perceptrons stacked in layers. The core learning principle—adjusting parameters to reduce errors—remains the foundation of AI training.",
    "commonMisconceptions": "- ❌ \"Perceptrons could solve any problem\" → ✅ They're limited to linearly separable problems\n- ❌ \"This was just software\" → ✅ The original was custom hardware with physical weight adjustments\n- ❌ \"Perceptrons were abandoned\" → ✅ They're the building blocks of modern deep learning"

    "tldr": "First chatbot that made people think they were talking to a human.",
    "simpleExplanation": "ELIZA was a simple program that pretended to be a therapist. It would take your statements, find keywords, and rephrase them as questions. Say 'I'm worried about my mother' and ELIZA might respond 'Tell me more about your family.'\n\nThe shocking part: people knew it was a program but still found themselves opening up emotionally. Some insisted ELIZA truly understood them. Weizenbaum, its creator, was disturbed by how easily humans attributed understanding to a simple pattern-matching trick.",
    "businessImpact": "- Demonstrated that conversational interfaces could engage users emotionally\n- Launched the entire chatbot industry (customer service bots, virtual assistants)\n- Revealed how humans anthropomorphize technology\n- Showed that 'good enough' responses can create illusion of understanding",
    "technicalDepth": "ELIZA used pattern matching with substitution rules. The DOCTOR script (simulating Rogerian therapy) was most famous. Rules like 'I am *' → 'How long have you been *?' required no understanding.\n\nThe system maintained no memory across exchanges and had no model of the conversation. It simply matched patterns and transformed inputs using templates.\n\nDespite its simplicity, ELIZA pioneered techniques still used: keyword spotting, template responses, deflection strategies for unrecognized inputs.",
    "historicalContext": "Weizenbaum created ELIZA partly to demonstrate how superficial computer 'understanding' was. He was alarmed when people treated it seriously, leading him to become a critic of AI hype.\n\nThe program appeared during the optimistic early AI era, serving as both a demonstration and a warning.",
    "whyItMattersToday": "Every customer service chatbot descends from ELIZA. The debate Weizenbaum started—do chatbots really understand?—is now central to discussions about ChatGPT and similar systems.",
    "commonMisconceptions": "- ❌ \"ELIZA used AI\" → ✅ It was pure pattern matching with no learning or reasoning\n- ❌ \"Weizenbaum was proud of fooling people\" → ✅ He was disturbed and became an AI critic\n- ❌ \"Modern chatbots work the same way\" → ✅ LLMs use fundamentally different technology, though the illusion question remains"

    "tldr": "Book that showed perceptrons' limits and triggered an AI winter.",
    "simpleExplanation": "Minsky and Papert wrote a mathematical analysis of perceptrons, proving they couldn't solve certain problems—like recognizing if a shape is connected or computing XOR (exclusive or). These weren't obscure edge cases; they were fundamental limitations.\n\nThe book's impact went beyond its mathematical content. It was widely interpreted as proving neural networks were a dead end, causing funding to dry up and researchers to abandon the approach for over a decade.",
    "businessImpact": "- Redirected AI research funding away from neural networks for 15+ years\n- Contributed to the first 'AI winter' of reduced funding and pessimism\n- Demonstrated how influential critiques can shape entire research fields\n- The problems they identified were eventually solved with multi-layer networks",
    "technicalDepth": "The book proved that single-layer perceptrons cannot compute functions that aren't linearly separable. The XOR problem is the canonical example: no single line can separate (0,0), (1,1) from (0,1), (1,0).\n\nThey also showed perceptrons couldn't determine connectivity or parity—properties requiring global information about inputs.\n\nCritically, while they acknowledged multi-layer networks might overcome these limits, they expressed skepticism about training them. Backpropagation, discovered later, solved this problem.",
    "historicalContext": "By 1969, initial AI optimism was fading. Government funders wanted results, and the perceptron hype had created unrealistic expectations. The book provided scientific justification for skepticism.\n\nMinsky and Papert were both influential figures, and their critique carried enormous weight.",
    "whyItMattersToday": "The book's lessons cut both ways: it showed rigorous criticism is valuable, but also how narrow critiques can be over-generalized to dismiss entire approaches that later prove successful.",
    "commonMisconceptions": "- ❌ \"They proved neural networks can't work\" → ✅ They proved single-layer networks have limits, which multi-layer networks overcome\n- ❌ \"Their math was wrong\" → ✅ Their proofs were correct; the over-generalization was the problem\n- ❌ \"They killed neural network research intentionally\" → ✅ The broader interpretation exceeded their claims"

Instead of saying 'do this, then that,' you'd say 'X is a grandparent of Y if X is a parent of Z and Z is a parent of Y.' The computer figures out how to find answers.\n\nThis made it natural to build systems that reasoned about relationships, rules, and knowledge—exactly what symbolic AI researchers wanted.",
    "businessImpact": "- Became the primary language for expert systems development\n- Powered the Japanese Fifth Generation Computer project\n- Influenced database query languages and constraint programming\n- Still used in specific domains like legal reasoning and bioinformatics",
    "technicalDepth": "Prolog uses first-order logic with Horn clauses. Programs consist of facts (statements) and rules (implications). The interpreter uses unification and backtracking to find solutions.\n\nQuery resolution works backward from goals: to prove something, find rules whose conclusions match, then try to prove their premises.\n\nProlog's closed-world assumption treats anything not provable as false, which has both practical benefits and theoretical limitations.",
    "historicalContext": "Prolog emerged from work by Colmerauer and Kowalski in Edinburgh and Marseille. It represented the symbolic AI approach: intelligence comes from manipulating symbols according to logical rules.\n\nThe 1970s saw symbolic AI dominant, and Prolog was its programming embodiment.",
    "whyItMattersToday": "While neural networks dominate modern AI, logic-based approaches persist in areas requiring explainability, formal verification, and structured reasoning. Hybrid neuro-symbolic systems are an active research area.",

A medical diagnosis system might have rules like 'IF patient has fever AND cough AND traveled to tropical region, THEN consider malaria.' By encoding hundreds of such rules from doctors, the system could advise on diagnoses.\n\nFor the first time, AI delivered real business value. Companies like DEC saved millions using expert systems to configure computer orders.",

    "technicalDepth": "Expert systems consist of a knowledge base (facts and rules) and an inference engine (mechanism for applying rules). Most used forward chaining (data-driven) or backward chaining (goal-driven) reasoning.\n\nKnowledge acquisition was the bottleneck: extracting rules from experts proved difficult and expensive. Maintaining rule consistency as systems grew became increasingly problematic.\n\nSystems like MYCIN (medical diagnosis) achieved expert-level performance in narrow domains but couldn't handle cases outside their rule sets.",
    "historicalContext": "After the post-Perceptrons pessimism, expert systems provided a success story. They fit the symbolic AI paradigm: intelligence as rule manipulation.\n\nThe excitement led to the founding of numerous AI companies and massive corporate investment, followed by a crash when limitations became clear.",

When a network makes a wrong prediction, backprop calculates exactly how much each connection contributed to the error, then adjusts them all to do better next time.\n\nImagine a factory assembly line where a defective product emerges. Backprop traces back through every station to identify what each one did wrong and how much to adjust. This made training networks with multiple layers practical.",

Starting from the output error, gradients flow backward through layers.\n\nThe 1986 paper by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams demonstrated learning internal representations—hidden layers could discover useful features without explicit programming.\n\nKey insight: while single perceptrons can't solve XOR, multi-layer networks trained with backprop can. This addressed the Minsky-Papert critique.",
